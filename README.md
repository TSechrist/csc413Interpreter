# csc413 - Interpreter

## Student Name : Thomas Sechrist

### This is a program that will interpret the made up programming language 'x' which is made up of various bytecode instructions.
### My interpreter will read in a file written in this made up language and process the instructions as they are in the given file.
### This program is written modularly in a way that you can easily add more instructions if needed for the 'x' programming language.
